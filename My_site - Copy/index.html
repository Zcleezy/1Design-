<h1>Manifesto of the subversive</h1>
<h2>Zarria Clark </h2>
<p>RULE ONE: Don't let the grid define you.</p>
<p>RULE TWO: Don't let the prompt limit you.</p>
<p>RULE THREE: CLients have no say Heck with them.</p>
<p>RULE FOUR: Consider everything an experiment.</p>
<p>RULE FIVE: Last minute is the best minute.</p>
<p>RULE SIX: Performance is the Art the final product is jsut the aftermath..</p>
<p>RULE SEVEN: The only rule is work. If you work it will lead to something. It’s the people who do all of the work all of the time who eventually catch on to things..</p>
<p>RULE EIGHT: Don’t try to create and analyze at the same time. They’re different processes.</p>
<p>RULE NINE: Be happy whenever you can manage it. Enjoy yourself. It’s lighter than you think..</p>
<p>RULE TEN: “We’re breaking all the rules. Even our own rules. And how do we do that? By leaving plenty of room for X quantities.” (John Cage).</p>
<p>HINTS: Always be around. Come or go to everything. Always go to classes. Read anything you can get your hands on. Look at movies carefully, often. Save everything — it might come in handy later..</p>
<p>There should be new rules next week.</p>
